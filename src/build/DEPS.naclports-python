# naclports publishes continuous build artifacts to googlestorage, with
# a browsable front-end at gsdview.appspot.com/naclports/builds/.  Any recent
# python distribution should be fine for this purpose, we do not compile
# anything else against it so it just needs to function hermetically with our
# apk_to_crx.py script.
# Note: If the python distribution changes versions (currently 2.7.7),
#       arc_welder/NOTICE needs to be updated to match.
# Also note: This is now pointing to arc-build/naclports as we stripped the
# x86_32 bits from the python.zip package (see README inside).
